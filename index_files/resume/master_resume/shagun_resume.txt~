Research Projects
      Developing a new system for Big Data Analytics Summer 2013
   *
      Brown University Providence, Rhode Island
        => Worked on a project to construct a distributed memory abstraction using LLVM and Julia that lets
            the programmers perform in-memory computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner.

      Hybridization Methods for the analysis of Biomolecular Networks May 2009 - July 2009
   *
      Institut National De Recherche En Informatique Et En Automatique Paris, France
        => Proposed a mathematical model to calculate Violation Degree, a measure of how far a given numerical
            trace is from satisfying a temporal logic specification.
        => Composed a MATLAB library to implement this model
        => Increased the calculation speed of Violation Degree by about 30 times and demonstrated the
            calculations for more complex specification models and properties.
        => Fashioned this library to guide the search for models satisfying a given specification.


Relevant Coursework

Academic Projects
      Comparative analysis of approaches to sentiment analysis of tweets Jan 2013 - May 2013
   *
      Guide: Prof. Latifur Khan
        => Implemented an application of twitter data processing in Java that predicted the ratings of movies
            using three different approaches, and compared the ratings obtained with IMDB rating.
        => The first approach used standard lists of positive and negative words to classify each tweet.
        => The second approach used the sentiment140 api for the classification using MapReduce.
        => The third approach created a classification model using a training-and-testing data with naive Bayes
            method in Mahout, and then used this model to classify each tweet, thereby rating it.
                                                                                                                    

      Programming Project in Artificial Intelligence Jan 2013 - May 2013
   *
      Guide: Prof. Haim Schweitzer
        => Designed and developed a project in Python that simulates Nine Men's Morris board game.
        => Wrote efficient codes to output the best possible moves using the Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta
           pruning algorithm. The code worked correctly for both white and black players, and in the opening,
           midgame and end-game phases.
        => Earned the position of first champion in the tournament for this game in the class (76 students)
           using reliable and fast code and innovative self-designed static estimation algorithms.
      Date-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce Jan 2013 - Feb 2013
   *
        => Applied Hadoop mapreduce to derive innovative statistics from the White House Visitor Log
           containing 2.9 million records.
        => Wrote efficient programs in Java to output the results and used mapreduce chaining for efficiency.
      Database Design and Implementation Project Aug 2012 - Dec 2012
   *
        => Compiled a conceptual design (EER model) for a large custom City library database project.
        => Developed a relational schema in third normal form for this design and wrote SQL statements to
           create the database and views, populate the tables and solve challenging queries.
        => Assembled the database in Oracle and used a database state to verify the correctness of queries.

Professional Experience

      Software Developer Jan 2011 - June 2012
   *
      Future Bazaar Mumbai, India
        => Head of the Analytics and Business Intelligence Team.

           databases (ATG, Oracle, MySQL) into a single MySQL database.
        => Conceptualized and implemented Order Life-cycle Management, a system to assign and regulate
           order-states to the order-items using Python.
        => Independently developed sellers.futurebazaar.com, an interface for the sellers to track orders, sales
           summary and product reviews, upload product inventory and edit profile settings.
        => Helped design and build the E-commerce platforms for the websites futurebazaar.com and
